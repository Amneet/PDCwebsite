          Each department in University of Ottawa can have a student association.{" "}
          <a href="https://gsaed.ca/en/about-us/">GSAED</a> (Graduate Student
          Association of University of Ottawa) represents the Graduate students at
          uOttawa and in order to create or activate your departmental student
          association, interested students should contact GSAED to learn more.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          The steps are elaborated below. We are saying, create or, activate your
          departmental graduate student association because an association might
          not exist at present time but there might have been one in past. So, if
          there was one, you can simply activate the association going through
          this process. But if an association was never created, you will have to
          go start from scratch.
        </p>

        <p> You can find the list of associations here.</p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Following are the steps you have to take to establish your programâ€™s
          association:
        </p>
        <div class="ui ordered list">
          <p class="item">
            First, find out if your departmental graduate student association
            already exists. Check the list of association in GSAED website too. If
            they are there, find a way to communicate with them. It is possible
            your association has a website, like{" "}
            <a href="http://ssgsauottawa.wordpress.com/">System Science</a>,{" "}
            <a href="https://ebtuottawa.ca/">E-Business</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="item">
            If you have not found a way to contact your departmental graduate
            student association, you should now seek help from GSAED. You can
            either go to their office located at the second floor of{" "}
            <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Caf%C3%A9+Nostalgica/@45.4239118,-75.684085,17.03z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x4e562941be8e6756!8m2!3d45.4240167!4d-75.6839936">

            , or send an email to Lucie Morin (gsaed@uottawa.ca) or, the Internal
            Commissioner (internal@gsaed.ca) requesting to provide you information
            about whether your departmental graduate student association is
            currently active or not. If it is active, request for the contact
            information of actual executives and get in touch with them.
          </p>
          <p class="item">
            If your association is not currently active but students in past had
            established one (which you can confirm from GSAED), request for bylaw
            from previous students. Study and understand the Bylaw, it will govern
            your departmental student association. Make sure you have clearly
            defined the position of executives in your association, their roles
            and how to elect them.
          </p>

          <p class="item">
            Once you have the Bylaw, next step to send the bylaw out for review.
            Send it out through email. You can request the emails of all students
            in your program through GSAED (again, you have to contact The Internal
            commissioner or, Lucie to get the emails). You should have some time
            (seven to ten days) after you send the Bylaw to allow students to read
            through it and give their comments on it and vote at a general
            assembly.
          </p>
          <p class="item">
            After review process, you have to now conduct fair election. Election
            can be done in many ways, like Ballot, online voting through google
            forms etc. but whatever mechanism you choose, it should be within the
            scope of bylaw that you have finalized by step 4. It needs to be a
            fair and independent process.
          </p>
          <p class="item">
            When election concludes, you have your executives for your
            association. Get together and proceed to formal registration of your
            Association. There is a form of registration you have to fill which
            will be provided by GSAED. You need to have at-least 2 co-signers for
            handling bank account of association so, make your mind beforehand
            about who is to be co-signer.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Once you have submitted the form you will get a letter from GSAED that
          will say you are recognized as a graduate student association and the
          co-signers will be handling bank account. When you open a bank account
          only then will the University will provide the association with money to
          carry out the events for students in your program.
